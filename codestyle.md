# Code Style Guidelines

## General Principles
- Follow a consistent naming convention (CamelCase for classes and methods, lowerCamelCase for variables).
- Ensure readability and maintainability by using clear and descriptive names.
- Comment on complex logic to enhance understanding.

## Java Code Style

### Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation. Avoid tabs.
- Limit lines to 120 characters.
- Maintain consistent spacing around operators and after commas.

### Annotations and Imports
- Place annotations above method definitions.
- Group imports logically and remove unused imports.

### Exception Handling
- Use specific exceptions for error handling. 
- Return meaningful error messages in response bodies.

### RESTful Practices
- Use HTTP status codes appropriately (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for client errors).

## JavaScript Code Style

### Formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var` for variable declarations.

### Function Structure
- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions.
- Prefer explicit parameter handling for better readability.

### Error Handling
- Implement error handling in promise-based functions.
- Use meaningful messages for logging errors.

## Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies to maintain security and performance.
- Use tools like ESLint for JavaScript and Checkstyle for Java to enforce coding standards.

## Documentation
- Use Javadoc for Java methods.
- Document all public APIs clearly for easier understanding and usage.
